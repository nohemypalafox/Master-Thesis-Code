# Master-Thesis-Code

In this repository are the python codes used on my master thesis. 
We have made an adaptation on python code of some examples from [1]

The code structure, for every example, consist on three diferents files:

* a file for the implementation of the model,
* a file for the implementation of the forward-backward sweep method,and
* a file for the simulation and graphics.
